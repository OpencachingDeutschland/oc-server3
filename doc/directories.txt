             Opencaching Implementation Version 3

                     Directory structure


There are three library framworks:

- The old OC 1.0 library which we call "lib1",
- the new OC 2.0 library which we call "lib2",
- the Opencaching.se library which we call "libse".

lib1 code is being ported to lib2 and will completely disappear.


When adding or renaming code directories, add them also to file scanning in

- htdocs/translate.php
- local/tools/find_bad_encodings.php
- local/tools/find_unicode_boms.php


Main directories
----------------

bin         code and database maintenance scripts

doc         documentaion

htdocs      everything which regularly runs on the Opencaching website

local       Special-purpose tools which may be used on development or
            productive systems.


htdocs subdirectories
---------------------

api         miscellaneous simple APIs for external tools;
            other APIs are in 'okapi' and in 'xml'.

cache       lib1 temporary files
cache2      lib2 temporary files, precompiled and cached data
config2     lib2 settings files. lib1 settings are in htdocs/lib/settings*.
doc         database documentation, static data and user documentation

download    temporary files for XML interface requests, see htdocs/xml.
            Directory is configured via lib/settings.inc.php, $zip_basedir
            and $zip_wwwdir.
            Note that zip downloads via seach.php are not stored in the file
            system but directly streamed.

html        some alternatives to index.php which may be displayed e.g.
            if site is out of service

images      images for several purposes
  flag/flags:  used by both lib1 and lib2. For compatibility reasons with
               "external" links e.g. in cache descriptions, they will have to stay here.
  icons        GC replacement icons for smiley links in copied cache descriptions and logs
  statpics     cached statistics pictures, referenced indirectly via
               htdocs/statpics/.htaccess -> ocstats.php rewrite
  uploads      uploaded cache and log pictures; directory is configured in lib1&2 settings 

lang        lib1 templates and resources; will all be ported to lib2, but some
            image file will stay here because they can by referenced elsewhere.

lib         OC 1.0 library (leftovers)
lib2        OC 2.0+ library, including 3rd party libraries
libse       Opencaching.se library, used for additional waypoints and "personal notes"
            in cache listings

old         obsolete files which are included for reference only and will be removed
            later. There are also some 'old' subdirectories at lower levels.

okapi       replicated from http://code.google.com/p/opencaching-api/source/browse/trunk/#trunk%2Fokapi
            with core.php:$revision replaced by current svn revision number

resource2   all lib2 files which are no PHP or Smarty code
templates2  all lib2 Smarty templates

statipcs    redirect source for statistics pictures, see images/statpics
