These files allow node- and language-dependent replacement of sys_trans_text
variables, e.g. %site_title% => name of the site. This system is not capable yet
of replacing menu links and was never used.

Other mechanisms - that are in use - are domain-dependent config variables
($opt['domain'][...]), local domain-dependent settings (settings.inc.php)
and language-dependent article links via helppageurl() / helppagelink().

None of these currently allows a complete customization of the site.
