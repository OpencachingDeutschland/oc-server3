This document describes the modification date fields. All these fields are
updated by "before update" triggers (see stored-proc/maintain.php). There are
some calculated / internally used fields, e.g. cache_logs.picture or
caches.need_npa_recalc, which DO NOT trigger a modification date update.

When adding data fields or tables, take care to fit them properly into the
modification date mechanisms (and also to listing archiving, see
restorecaches.php, and data export interfaces).


Active, user-provided content
=============================

caches
------

last_modified
	Is updated when any data of a caches record changes which is presented to
	the user and/or output by export interfaces. This triggers an XML interface
	update (resending) of the cache record, and an update of listing_last_modified
	and okapi_syncbase.

listing_last_modified
	The listing modification date, as displayed by viewcache and output via OKAPI,
	XML interface etc.; added with OC 3.0.6 to fix listing modification date.
	Is updated when the user enters/changes/deletes any properties of the cache
	listing which may be presented to the user or exported via XML interface.
	This triggers an update of okapi_syncbase.

	Currently fed directly from cache_desc, caches_logs and pictures [mp3 is
	missing], and indirectly from caches, caches_attributes and coordinates via
	caches.last_modified.

okapi_syncbase
	Is added by OKAPI upon installation and updated automatically on insertion and
	any changes of a caches record. This triggers a comparison of the current data
	of a geocache (everything which can be output by the geocache method) with data
	in okapi_cache and writing a changelog entry for replication if anything has
	changed.

	As the field is updated if listing_last_modified changes, OKAPI will be
	notified of any changes of the cache listing. However, the OKAPI geocaches
	method also outputs additional data like geokrets which is not entered by the
	user. Therefore okapi_syncbase needs to be updated on some additional events,
	which is done indirectly via meta_last_modified:

meta_last_modified
	Is updated if any data changes which is output by OKAPI's geocache method but
	not part of the cache listing itself. This currently applies to geokrets in
	the cache (gk_item_waypoint table) and to log and recommendation statistics
	(stat_caches table). Things like caches.wp_gc_maintained may be added.
	Updating this field triggers an update of okapi_syncbase. We don't update
	okapi_syncbase directly, as it may be missing because OKAPI is not installed.

	Note that this field is NOT updated on cache_logs changes, because OKAPI
	replication does not include logs in geocaches records but treats them as
	separate objects.

An additional field may be needed in the future for listing data which is not
provied by the owner (or admins), like wp_gc_maintained or "logger feedback"
on cache properties. As soon as this data is output via XML interface, it must
be incorporated into some new modification date field.


cache_logs
----------

last_modified
	Is updated when
		- any user-provided log content fields changes
		- the status of the cache changes, via sp_touch_cache()
	This triggers an XML interface update (resending) of the log record, and an
	update of listing_last_modified and okapi_syncbase.

	sp_touch_cache() is an awful hack. Probably its sole purpose is to send
	log records, cache descriptions and pictures through XML after a cache
	changes from invisible (state 4,5,7) to visible (1,2,3,6). Then, it may be
	optimized by
		- reacting only to changes from cache_status.allow_user_view=0 to
		  allow_user_view=1, or
		- introducing a separate flag or date field somewhere which triggers the
		  XML sending without compromising the logs etc. modification dates
		  (however, these dates are alredy fucked up for all cache status changes
		  up to now).

log_last_modified
	Like caches.listing_last_modified: The log modification date including data
	in other tables, i.e. in pictures [mp3 may be added]. Added with OC 3.0.7
	to fix OKAPI log pictures issue.

okapi_syncbase
	Is added by OKAPI upon installation and updated automatically on insertion
	and any changes of a log record. This is needed as logs are separate objects
	in OKAPI replication, too. Further handling similar to caches.okapi_syncbase.


cache_desc
pictures
mp3
----------

last_modified
	like cache_logs.last_modified;
	mp3 implementation is incomplete


coordinates
-----------

last_modified
	This was added together with date_created shortly after OC 3.0.5 release,
	because someone thought that it is needed to solve the listing modification
	date problem and for adding "additional waypoints" to the XML interface.
	Then the former was solved via listing_last_modified (which is more universal)
	and the latter by directly incorporating additional wps into the XML cache
	records, which is much simpler than separate objects.

	So both fields may be discarded, IF they are not useful for any future
	purpose (maybe we want to know when a "personal note" was changed?). Currently
	they are only used within triggers and stored procs, including
	sp_updateall_cache_listingdates. They are incomplete anyway, because we don't
	know the dates for data entered prior to release 3.0.6.


Archived user-provided content
==============================

cache_logs_archived
-------------------

This table probably was added in the beginning of 2012. It archives all
deleted logs.

last_modified
	Is updated to current date together with date_created when archiving a log.
	This does not exactly make sense, and may be changed, but as this field is
	not used anywhere, it probably doesn't matter.

okapi_syncbase
	Is added by OKAPI upon installation and set automatically on insertion of a
	log archive record. This way, OKAPI replication keeps track of deleted logs.


cache_coordinates
cache_countries
-----------------

Every time a cache record is created or its coordinates or country are changed,
the coordinates resp. country are copied into a new record in one or both of
these tables. These tables were introduced for some sophisticted XML interface
distance search behaviour, but since OC 3.0.6 are also used for the listing
restore function (see below).

date_created
	The date when the record was inserted, which is the creation date of the
	caches record for new caches, and the modification date for further changes
	of cache coordinates or country.


caches_modified (date only)
caches_attributes_modified (date only)
cache_desc_modified (date only)
cache_logs_restored
pictures_modified
--------------------------

Added with listing versioning & restore function (vandalism reversal) in
OC 3.0.6 (see restorecaches.php).

date_modified
	The date when the listing or log property was modified and the old data
	was stored in the archiving table.
	Some tables do not record the time to minimize the archived data amount:
	Only the first data change of each day is backed up.


Calculated and statistical content
==================================

cache_location
--------------

last_modified
	Is used to keep cache_location in sync with caches, i.e. update the
	code/adm1..code4/adm4 data if coordinates have changed.
	(Actually, the location data is updated on any cache record change.)


cache_visits
------------

last_modified
	Keeps track of multiple visits of the same user or IP within 24 hours.
	Ony one visit per day is counted.
	Actually this is rather a "last referenced" field similar to
	map2_data.date_lastqueried or queries.last_queried.
