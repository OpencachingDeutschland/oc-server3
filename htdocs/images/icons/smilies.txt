This are replacement smilies for GC images which are frequently linked from
copied cache descriptions and logs. icon_smile_dissapprove is a GC misspelling;
icon is kept in both spellings for the case they fix it.

Icons are partly from /htdocs/resource2/tinymce/plugins/emotions/img and
from free-to-use smilie site http://www.smilys.net.
