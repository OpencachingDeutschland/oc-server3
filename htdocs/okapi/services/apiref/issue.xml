        <p>OKAPI is trying to be as <b>integrated</b> with its
        <a href='https://github.com/opencaching/okapi/'>Main Project Page</a> as it can.
        This method retrieves basic information on a given issue from our project
        <a href='https://github.com/opencaching/okapi/issues/'>Issue Tracker</a>
        (currently GitHub).
        In future, it <b>might</b> also return some of the latest comments (we're not yet
        sure if we want them displayed on our documentation pages).</p>
    </desc>
    <req name='issue_id'>
        ID of an Issue.
    </req>
    <common-format-params/>
    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary of the following structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>id</b> - number of the issue created for this method,</li>
            <li><b>last_updated</b> - date and time (ISO 8601) when the issue was last updated
                <b>or null</b> if unknown,</li>
