        Get the list of all public OKAPI installations. Keep in mind that
        OKAPI installations might differ slightly. If you plan on using
        multiple OKAPI installations in your application (which is a very
        good thing!) you should test it against the one with the <b>lowest</b>
        OKAPI version number.

    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary of the following structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>site_url</b> - URL of the Opencaching site which is running
                the OKAPI installation (usually this looks like
                "https://www.opencaching.<i>xx</i>/", where <b>xx</b> is a top
                level domain of a country).

                <p>Once OKAPI maintainers are notified that this particular site
                supports HTTPS, this field will return a HTTPS URL from then on.
                Otherwise, HTTP URL will be returned.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>site_name</b> - universal name for this site (should be fine
                for all languages),
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>okapi_base_url</b> - URL of the OKAPI installation (usually this is
                <b>site_url</b> with "okapi/" appended, but you should not assume
                that); this value is to be used as a prefix when constructing service
                method URLs.</p>

                <p>Once OKAPI maintainers are notified that this particular site
                supports HTTPS, this field will return a HTTPS URL from then on.
                Otherwise, HTTP URL will be returned.</p>
