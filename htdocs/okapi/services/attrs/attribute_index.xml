    <brief>Get the list of all OKAPI attributes (A-codes)</brief>
    <issue-id>270</issue-id>
    <desc>
        <p>This method returns <b>all</b> currently defined OKAPI geocache-attributes.
        It is useful when you want to cache the data on the client-side.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that the number of attributes will grow. Hence, <b>if your application
        uses multiple OKAPI servers, then it's best to use one of the frequently
        updated servers for pre-caching attribute data</b> (currently, Opencaching.PL
        is the most frequently updated installation). Also, you should never assume
        that you have the complete list cached: A new attribute may be created at any time!</p>

        <p>Once an attribute is published via this method, it won't disappear, nor
        will its meaning change (names and descriptions can be slightly altered though).</p>

    <opt name='langpref' default='en'>
        Works the same as in the <b>attribute</b> method.
    </opt>
    <opt name='fields' default='name'>
        Works the same as in the <b>attribute</b> method.
    </opt>
    <opt name='only_locally_used' default='false'>
        <p>By default, all known attributes are returned - including those which
        were used a couple of years back, or those which are used by other OC nodes
        (and may perhaps be used by the local OC node in the future). If you're
        interested only in the attributes *currently used* within *this* Opencaching
        installation, then you may set this parameter to <b>true</b>.</p>
    </opt>

    <returns>
        A dictionary. All A-codes will be mapped to dictionary keys, and
        each value will be an object, as described in the <b>attribute</b> method.
    </returns>
