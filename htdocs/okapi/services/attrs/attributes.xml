        <p>This method works like the <b>attribute</b> method, but
        with multiple A-codes instead of only one. Read the docs for
        the <b>attribute</b> method first!</p>
    </desc>
    <req name='acodes'>
        Pipe-separated list of A-codes you're interested in.
    </req>
    <opt name='langpref' default='en'>
        Works the same as in the <b>attribute</b> method.
    </opt>
    <opt name='fields' default='name'>
        Works the same as in the <b>attribute</b> method.
    </opt>
    <opt name='forward_compatible' default='true'>
        This has a similar meaning as in the <b>attribute</b> method, but works
        differently. If set to <b>false</b>, OKAPI will return <b>null</b>s
        for unknown keys (A-codes). You will still receive an HTTP 200 response
        though!
    </opt>
    <common-format-params/>
    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary. A-codes you provide will be mapped to dictionary keys,
        and each value will be an object, as described in the <b>attribute</b>
        method.</p>
    </returns>
