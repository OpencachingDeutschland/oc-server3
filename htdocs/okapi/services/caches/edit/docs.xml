    <desc>
        <p>This method allows your users to change properties of an owned
        geocache. Currently, only the log password can be changed.
        Let us know if you need to edit other geocache properties.</p>
    </desc>
    <req name='cache_code'>
        <p>Code of the geocache.</p>
    </req>
    <opt name='passwd'>
        <p>String - the new password for 'Found it' or 'Attended' log entries.
        If you supply an empty string, the password will be cleared, i.e.
        the geocache will not require a log password.</p>
        <p>You may query the maximum accepted password length for the OC site by
        <a href='%OKAPI:methodargref:services/apisrv/installation%'>services/apsrv/installation</a>.
        There may also be installation-dependent restrictions on which
        geocaches may have passwords. <b>success</b> will be <b>false</b> and
        an explanation message will be returned if a password is rejected.</p>
    </opt>
    <opt name='langpref' default='en'>
        <p>Pipe-separated list of ISO 639-1 language codes. This indicates the
        order of preference in which language will be chosen for the
        <b>messages</b> return value.</p>
    </opt>
    <common-format-params/>
    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary of the following structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>success</b> - boolean,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>true</b> if all of the supplied geocache properties
                    were saved successfully or if no property to be changed was
                    supplied. The geocache's <b>last_modified</b> date has been
                    updated if any property was changed,</li>
                    <li><b>false</b> if nothing was saved, which means that at
                    least one of the supplied parameters was not acceptable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>messages</b> - a dictionary of the supplied parameters
                that were not acceptable, each entry giving a plain-text string
                that explains the reason of rejection. The dictionary is empty
                in case of success.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </returns>
