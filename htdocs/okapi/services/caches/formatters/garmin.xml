	<brief>Retrieve ZIP file for Garmin devices</brief>
	<issue-id>99</issue-id>
	<desc>
		<p>Produce a ZIP file with content compatible with Geocaching-enabled Garmin
		GPS devices. The general idea is, <b>you should <u>extract</u> the contents</b> of the ZIP
		file directly <b>into the root directory</b> of your Garmin's internal memory storage
		(currently it doesn't work if you extract the data to the external MicroSD card). The device
		will then be filled with all the data we are currently able to fill it with.</p>
		<p>Currently, the ZIP file will contain GPX file and all JPEG images associated
		with the chosen geocaches. Options for the GPX file are fixed, use the
		services/caches/formatters/gpx method if
		you want a custom-tailored GPX file.</p>
		<p><b>Important note:</b> The contents of the returned ZIP archive may change in the
		future. You should not parse the contents, nor assume that they have any specific
		structure.</p>
		<p><b>Important note:</b> We might be increasing required authentication level for
		this method to level 2 or 3. You should be prepared for that. Use the highest authentication
		level you've got. Also, if you want the GPX file to include <b>personal data (like user's notes)</b>,
		you have to use Level 3 Authentication anyway.</p>
		<p><b>Note:</b> All non-JPEG images will be skipped. Currently OKAPI does not convert
		other types of images to JPEG.</p>

	<req name='cache_codes'>
		<p>Pipe-separated list of cache codes which you are interested in.
		No more than 50 codes are allowed. (This limit is smaller than usual, because
		we're afraid about the sizes of ZIP files produced.)
		This CAN be an empty string (it will still result in a valid ZIP file).</p>
	</req>
	<opt name='langpref' default='en'>
		<p>Pipe-separated list of ISO 639-1 language codes. This indicates the
		order of preference in which language will be chosen for GPX entities.</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='images' default='all'>
		<p>One of the following values:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>none</b> - no images will be included in the result,</li>
			<li><b>all</b> - all images will be included in the result,</li>
			<li><b>spoilers</b> - only spoiler images will be included in the result,</li>
			<li><b>nonspoilers</b> - only non-spoiler images will be included in the result.</li>
		</ul>
	</opt>
	<returns>
		<p>ZIP file. You should extract it's contents directly into the root
		directory of your Garmin's internal memory storage.</p>
