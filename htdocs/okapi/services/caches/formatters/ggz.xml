        <p><b>Important note:</b> This is a <b>BETA</b> method. It's interface may change
        in a backward-incompatible manner, or it may even be removed.</p>

        <p>Generate a Garmin GGZ file - an alternative to GPX files, compatible with newer
        Geocaching-enabled Garmin GPS devices. Internally, GGZ file is a ZIP file - it includes
        the GPX file, plus an index file which allows the device to access specific geocaches
        much faster.</p>

        <p>Currently, this method takes the same parameters as the
        <a href="%OKAPI:methodref:services/caches/formatters/gpx%">services/caches/formatters/gpx</a>
        method. Only the output format is different.</p>

    <import-params method='services/caches/formatters/gpx'/>
    <returns>
        <p>A GGZ file. You should copy the file to Garmin's internal memory storage.</p>
    </returns>
