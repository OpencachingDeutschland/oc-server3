	<brief>Retrieve geocaches in GPX format</brief>
	<issue-id>40</issue-id>
	<desc>
		<p>Produces a standards-compliant Geocaching GPX file.</p>
		<p>Unlike the services/caches/geocaches method responses, GPX files cannot
		contain names and descriptions in separate multiple languages. This method
		will attempt to choose the best language based on your preference
		(see <b>langpref</b> argument).</p>
		<p>Remember that a full-blown GPX file is much larger than a basic one.
		This method can produce many various types of GPX files. The simplest list of
		waypoints takes ~50 times less space than the same list with cache descriptions
		and log entries included.</p>
	</desc>
	<req name='cache_codes'>
		<p>Pipe-separated list of cache codes which you are interested in.
		No more than 500 codes are allowed. This CAN be an empty string (it will
		result in an empty, but valid, GPX file). All invalid cache codes will
		be skipped without any notice!</p>
	</req>
	<opt name='langpref' default='en'>
		<p>Pipe-separated list of ISO 639-1 language codes. This indicates the
		order of preference in which language will be chosen for GPX entities.</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='ns_ground' default='false'>
		Boolean. If <b>true</b> then response will include
		<a href='http://www.groundspeak.com/cache/1/0/cache.xsd'>Groundspeak's
		GPX extension</a>. This namespace declares an extra &lt;cache&gt; element
		used by <a href='http://www.geocaching.com/'>geocaching.com</a> and <b>many others</b>.
		This namespace was initially associatied with geocaching.com, but now seems to
		be used in every geocaching GPX file. You probably want to have it.
	</opt>
	<opt name='ns_gsak' default='false'>
		<p>Boolean. If <b>true</b> then response will include
		<a href='http://www.gsak.net/xmlv1/5/gsak.xsd'>GSAK GPX extension</a>.
		This namespace declares an extra &lt;wptExtension&gt; element,
		which allows including "waypoint inheritance" information (parent-child relations).
		This in turn allows us to include "alternate waypoints" in the response.</p>
		<p>We know of <b>at least</b> <a href='http://www.gsak.net/'>one tool</a> that
		makes use of this.</p> 
	</opt>
	<opt name='ns_ox' default='false'>
		Boolean. If <b>true</b> then response will include Garmin's
		<a href='http://www.opencaching.com/xmlschemas/opencaching/1/0/opencaching.xsd'>Opencaching.com
		GPX extension</a>. This namespace declares an extra &lt;opencaching&gt; element
		used by <a href='http://www.opencaching.com/'>Garmin's Opencaching.com</a>.
		The element includes information on cache difficulty, ratings, tags and images.
		It is used within Garmin's Geocaching-enabled handheld GPS devices.
	</opt>
	<opt name='images' default='descrefs:nonspoilers'>
		<p>Which images to include (and how to include them). One of the following values:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>none</b> - no images will be included,</li>
			<li><b>descrefs:nonspoilers</b> - all non-spoiler images will be included
			as &lt;img&gt; references at the end of each cache description,</li>
			<li><b>descrefs:all</b> - all images will be included (including spoilers)
			as &lt;img&gt; references at the end of each cache description,</li>
			<li><b>ox:all</b> - all images will be included (including spoilers)
			as Garmin's &lt;ox:image&gt; references.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note: When using "descrefs:" mode, remember to set <b>ns_ground</b> to <b>true</b>.</p>
		<p>Note: When using "ox:" mode, remember to set <b>ns_ox</b> to <b>true</b>. You must also
		include JPEG files along the GPX for this to work properly - see
		services/caches/formatters/garmin for more information.</p>
		<p>In the future, more generic ways of including images in GPX files may emerge.</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='attrs' default='desc:text'>
		<p>This argument controls wether cache attributes are included and how they are included.
		One of the following values:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>none</b> - no attributes will be included,</li>
			<li><b>desc:text</b> - attributes will be listed (in plain-text) within the cache description,</li>
			<li><b>ox:tags</b> - attributes will be converted to Garmin's ox:tag elements.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note: When using "desc:" mode, remember to set <b>ns_ground</b> to <b>true</b>.</p>
		<p>Note: When using "ox:" mode, remember to set <b>ns_ox</b> to <b>true</b>.</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='trackables' default='none'>
		<p>This argument controls wether information on trackables is included and how it is included.
		One of the following values:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>none</b> - no trackables-data will be included,</li>
			<li><b>desc:list</b> - trackables will be listed (in plain-text) within the cache description,</li>
			<li><b>desc:count</b> - total number of trackables will be included (in plain-text) within the cache description.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note: When using "desc:" mode, remember to set <b>ns_ground</b> to <b>true</b>.</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='recommendations' default='none'>
		<p>This argument controls wether information on recommendations is included and how it is included.
		One of the following values:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>none</b> - no recommendations-info will be included,</li>
			<li><b>desc:count</b> - number of recommendations (and founds) will be included
				(in plain-text) within the cache description.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note: When using "desc:" mode, remember to set <b>ns_ground</b> to <b>true</b>.</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='my_notes' default='none'>
		<p>Allows you to include personal user's notes on each cache. One of the following values:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>none</b> - don't include personal notes,</li>
			<li><b>desc:text</b> - include personal notes as part of the cache description.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note: You need to use Level 3 Authentication in order to set it to anything else than "none".</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='latest_logs' default='false'>
		<p>Boolean. If <b>true</b> then response will include a couple of
		latest log entries for this cache (see also the <b>lpc</b> argument).</p>
		<p>You <b>must</b> set <b>ns_ground</b> argument to <b>true</b> if you want to use this.</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='lpc' default='10'>
		Log-entries per cache - the number of log entries included in each returned cache.
		This should be an integer or a special "all" value. Please note, that the <b>ns_ground</b>
		and <b>latest_logs</b> arguments must be set to <b>true</b> in order for the logs to be included.
	</opt>
	<opt name='alt_wpts' default='false'>
		<p>Boolean. If <b>true</b> then we will include additional (alternate) waypoints in the response.
		These are all places associated with the cache.</p>
		<p>Combine this with <b>ns_gsak</b> if you want the result to include additional references between
		waypoints and their geocaches. Please note that not many applications are currently able to
		properly understand GSAK metadata.</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='mark_found' default='false'>
		<p>Boolean. If <b>true</b> then all caches which are already found, will be marked appropriately
		(i.e. with an "found cache" symbol).</p>
		<p>This field requires you to use the <b>user_uuid</b> parameter (or Level 3 Authentication).</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name="user_uuid">
		<p>User'd ID. Required to mark found caches using <b>Level 1</b> Authentication.</p>
		<p>If you use <b>Level 3</b> Authentication, you shouldn't use this parameter. Or, to be exact:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>user_uuid</b> will be extracted from the Access Token you use. You don't have to provide it.</li>
			<li>If you provide <b>user_uuid</b>, then it HAS TO match your Access Token. If it doesn't, OKAPI
			will respond with HTTP 400 error.</li>
		</ul>
	</opt>
	<returns>
		<p>GPX file. All invalid cache codes will be skipped without any notice!</p>
