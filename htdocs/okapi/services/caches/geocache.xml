	<req name='cache_code'>Unique code of the geocache</req>
	<opt name='langpref' default='en'>
		<p>Pipe-separated list of ISO 639-1 language codes. This indicates the
		order of preference in which language will be chosen for fields like
		<b>name</b> and <b>description</b>.</p>
		<p>Please note, that you may also access caches' descriptions in all
		available languages. If you want to do this, you should use fields
		<b>names</b>, <b>descriptions</b> (etc.) instead of <b>name</b> and
		<b>description</b> (etc.).</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='fields' default='code|name|location|type|status'>
		<p>Pipe-separated list of field names which you are interested with.
		Selected fields will be included in the response.</p>
		<p>Currently available fields:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>code</b> - unique Opencaching code of the geocache,</li>
			<li><b>name</b> - name of the geocache,</li>
			<li><b>names</b> - a dictionary (language code => plain-text string) of
				names of the geocache (at this time, there will be only one language,
				but this may change in future),</li>
			<li><b>location</b> - location of the cache in the "lat|lon" format
				(<i>lat</i> and <i>lon</i> are in full degrees with a dot as a decimal point),</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>type</b> - cache type. This might be <b>pretty much everything</b>,
				but there are some predefined types that you might want to treat
				in a special way (separate icons etc.). Primary types include: </p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Traditional</b>,</li>
					<li><b>Multi</b>,</li>
					<li><b>Quiz</b>,</li>
					<li><b>Virtual</b>,</li>
					<li><b>Event</b>,</li>
					<li><i>(any other value is valid too)</i></li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Event</b> is a peculiar type of geocache which is NOT a geocache
				at all, but it <b>is</b> stored as a geocache in OC database (this design
				decision is old as the OC network itself!). Just keep in mind, that
				in case of Event Caches, some fields may have a little different meaning
				than you would tell by their name.</p>
			</li>

			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>bearing</b> - float, the absolute bearing to the cache, measured in degrees from north,
				<b>or null</b> if it cannot be calculated (i.e. when you are exactly at the target's location).

			<li>
				<p><b>is_found</b> - boolean, true if the user already found this cache.
				See also <b>found_status</b> parameter of the services/caches/search/all

			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>is_not_found</b> - boolean, true if the user has submitted "Didn't find it" log entry for this cache.</p>

				<p><b>oxsize</b> - float (between 1 and 5) or null, this is a size rating
				variant, compatible with the one used by opencaching.com (and lately,
				Garmin GPS devices).</p>

				<b>null</b> if unknown,
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>rating</b> - float (between 1 and 5), an overall rating of the cache,
				or <b>null</b> when the geocache does not have a sufficient amount of votes
				to have a rating.</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>attribution_note</b> - the proper attribution note for the cache listing according

				currently you have no way of knowing in which language it will appear
				in (but it *may* start to vary on the value of your <b>langpref</b>
				parameter in the future).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>state</b> - name of the state the cache is placed in;
				may be empty ("") if the state is unknown.</p>
				<p><b>Note:</b> On some installations this data is user-supplied and

					<li>the event takes place (for event caches),</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<!-- Note: I think cache uuids should not be ever revealed to the public.
			We have already one universally unique key - the cache code. It is uncommon
			to have multiple universally unique keys. -->
			<li><b>internal_id</b> - internal ID of the cache (<b>do not</b> use
				this, unless you know what you're doing; use the "code" as an identifier).</li>
		</ul>
	</opt>
	<opt name='attribution_append' default='full'>
		<p>By default, OKAPI appends the value of <b>attribution_note</b> field to all the
		cache descriptions. If you would like to display the attribution note separately,
		you may use this parameter. Use one of the following values:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>full</b> - OKAPI will append the attribution note to the descriptions of the
				geocache. The language of the note will match the language of the description
				(i.e. each value in <b>descriptions</b> may contain attribution notes in
				a different language).
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>none</b> - OKAPI will not append the attribution note to geocache
				descriptions. You will use the <b>attribution_note</b> instead (which depends
				on the <b>langpref</b> parameter).</p>
				
				<p><b>Important note:</b> You are still <b>required</b> to display the
				<b>attribution_note</b> field in some other way.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>static</b> - OKAPI will append a "static" attribution note to the descriptions
				of the geocache. This might equal the "full" attribution note, but not necessarilly,
				since the "full" note may contain a current date
				(<a href='https://code.google.com/p/opencaching-api/issues/detail?id=178'>why?</a>),
				and the "static" note will not. This is implemented primarily for internal use
				(i.e. the replicate module). Usually you should not use it, because on some
				installations the static note will not be sufficient to meet the data license
				requirements. 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</opt>
	<opt name='lpc' default='10'>
		Log-entries per cache - the number of logs returned in the <b>latest_logs</b> field.
		This should be an integer or a special "all" value. Please note, that you must include
		the <b>latest_logs</b> field in <b>fields</b> in order to see the log entries.
	</opt>
	<opt name='log_fields' default='uuid|date|user|type|comment'>
		Pipe-separated list of log fields to include in the <b>latest_logs</b> field.
		For valid field names, see <b>logs/entry</b> method.
	</opt>
	<opt name='my_location'>
		<p>The reference point for cache distance and bearing calculation (typically - the user's location),
		in the "lat|lon" format. This parameter is required when accessing <b>distance</b> and/or <b>bearing</b>
		fields.</p>
		<p>Use positive numbers for latitudes in the northern hemisphere and
		longitudes in the eastern hemisphere (and negative for southern and
		western hemispheres accordingly). These are full degrees with a dot
		as a decimal point (ex. "54.3|22.3").</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name="user_uuid">
		<p>User'd ID. Required to access fields like <b>is_found</b> using <b>Level 1</b> Authentication.</p>
		<p>Please note that if you want to access private fields (like <b>my_notes</b>), then
		this parameter won't help you. You have to use <b>Level 3</b> Authentication instead.</p>
		<p>If you use <b>Level 3</b> Authentication, you shouldn't use this parameter. Or, to be exact:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>user_uuid</b> will be extracted from the Access Token you use. You don't have to provide it.</li>
			<li>If you provide <b>user_uuid</b>, then it HAS TO match your Access Token. If it doesn't, OKAPI
			will respond with HTTP 400 error.</li>
		</ul>
	</opt>
	<common-format-params/>
	<returns>
		<p>A dictionary of fields you have selected.</p>
		<p>For example, for <i>geocache?cache_code=OP3D96&amp;fields=type</i>
		query, the result might look something link this:</p>
		<pre>{"type": "Traditional"}</pre>
		<p>If given cache code does not exist, the method will
		respond with an HTTP 400 error.</p>
