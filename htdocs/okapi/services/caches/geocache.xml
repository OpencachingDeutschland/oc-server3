	<req name='cache_code'>Unique code of the geocache</req>
	<opt name='langpref' default='en'>
		<p>Pipe-separated list of ISO 639-1 language codes. This indicates the
		order of preference in which language will be chosen for fields like
		<b>name</b> and <b>description</b>.</p>
		<p>Please note, that you may also access caches' descriptions in all
		available languages. If you want to do this, you should use fields
		<b>names</b>, <b>descriptions</b> (etc.) instead of <b>name</b> and
		<b>description</b> (etc.).</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='fields' default='code|name|location|type|status'>
		<p>Pipe-separated list of field names which you are interested with.
		Selected fields will be included in the response.</p>
		<p>Currently available fields:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>code</b> - unique code of the geocache,</li>
			<li><b>name</b> - name of the geocache,</li>
			<li><b>names</b> - a dictionary (language code => plain-text string) of
				names of the geocache (at this time, there will be only one language,
				but this may change in future),</li>
			<li><b>location</b> - location of the cache in the "lat|lon" format
				(<i>lat</i> and <i>lon</i> are in full degrees with a dot as a decimal point),</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>type</b> - cache type. This might be <b>pretty much everything</b>,
				but there are some predefined types that you might want to treat
				in a special way (separate icons etc.). Primary types include: </p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Traditional</b>,</li>
					<li><b>Multi</b>,</li>
					<li><b>Quiz</b>,</li>
					<li><b>Virtual</b>,</li>
					<li><b>Event</b>,</li>
					<li><i>(any other value is valid too)</i></li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Event</b> is a peculiar type of geocache which is NOT a geocache
				at all, but it <b>is</b> stored as a geocache in OC database (this design
				decision is old as the OC network itself!). Just keep in mind, that
				in case of Event Caches, some fields may have a little different meaning
				than you would tell by their name.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>status</b> - cache status. Valid cache status codes currently include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Available</b> - Cache is available and ready for search,</li>

				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>distance</b> - float, the distance to a cache, in meters.
				This requires <b>my_location</b> parameter to be provided.</p>
				<p>Please note, that sometimes it is faster to compute this yourself, on client-side, instead of querying OKAPI.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>bearing</b> - float, the absolute bearing to the cache, measured in degrees from north,
				<b>or null</b> if it cannot be calculated (i.e. when you are exactly at the target's location).
				This requires <b>my_location</b> parameter to be provided.</p>
				<p>Please note, that sometimes it is faster to compute this yourself, on client-side, instead of querying OKAPI.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>bearing2</b> - string, the absolute bearing to the cache, represented as a typical direction
				string of length of 1 or 2 characters (ex. "N", "NE", "E", "SE", etc.), or "n/a" if it cannot be calculated.
				This requires <b>my_location</b> parameter to be provided.</p>
				<p>Please note, that sometimes it is faster to compute this yourself, on client-side, instead of querying OKAPI.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>bearing3</b> - string, the absolute bearing to the cache, represented as a typical directon
				string of length of 1 or 2 or 3 characters (ex. "N", "NNE", "NE", "ENE", etc.), or "n/a" if it cannot be calculated.

			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>is_found</b> - boolean, true if the user already found this cache.
				See also <b>found_status</b> parameter of the services/caches/search/all
				method.</p>
				<p>This field requires you to use the <b>user_uuid</b> parameter
				(or Level 3 Authentication). Please note, that this will also return <b>true</b>
				for attended Event Caches.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>is_not_found</b> - boolean, true if the user has submitted "Didn't find it" log entry for this cache.</p>
				<p>This field requires you to use the <b>user_uuid</b> parameter (or Level 3 Authentication).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>is_watched</b> - boolean, true if the user is watching this cache. You may consider highlighting
				such geocaches in some fashion, as the users may use this functionality to temporarily mark geocaches
				of particular interest (i.e. geocaches they plan to find today).</p>
				<p>This is private data. You will need Level 3 Authentication to access this field.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>is_ignored</b> - boolean, true if the user is ignoring this cache. (See also <b>exclude_ignored</b>
				parameter of all search methods.)</p>

				(in case of Event Caches this will always be zero),</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>willattends</b> - in case of Event Caches, this is the number of
				"Will attend" log entries. In case of any other cache type, it will
				be <b>null</b></p>
			</li>
			<li class='deprecated'>
				<b>size</b> - deprecated
				(<a href='http://code.google.com/p/opencaching-api/issues/detail?id=155'>why?</a>),
				use <b>size2</b> instead. Float (between 1 and 5), size rating of the container, or
				<b>null</b> if geocache does not have a container,
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>size2</b> - string indicating the size od the container, so called 
				"size2 code". One of the following values:
				'none', 'nano', 'micro', 'small', 'regular', 'large', 'xlarge', 'other'.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>oxsize</b> - float (between 1 and 5) or null, this is a size rating
				variant, compatible with the one used by opencaching.com (and lately,
				Garmin GPS devices).</p>
				<p><b>Note:</b> The mapping is undocumented and may change without notice.</p>
				<p><b>Note:</b> Some of OC's size values cannot be properly mapped to <b>oxcode</b>,

				always be <b>null</b> on such installations.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>rating_votes</b> - number of votes submitted for the rating of this cache.</p>
				<p>Please note: some OC installations do not use the rating/voting system. The <b>rating_votes</b> will
				always be <b>0</b> on such installations.</p>

				unless user specifically asks for them,</li>
			<li><b>hints</b> - a dictionary (language code => plain-text string) of cache
				hints/spoilers,</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>images</b> - list of dictionaries, each dictionary represents one
				image saved along the cache description; each dictionary has the

					<li><b>caption</b> - plain-text string, caption of the image,</li>
					<li><b>unique_caption</b> - plain-text string, to be used as a filename
						for Garmin's crappy images implementation (currently, they get image
						caption from the image's filename itself),</li>
					<li><b>is_spoiler</b> - boolean, if <b>true</b> then the image is
						a spoiler image and should not be displayed to the user unless
						the user explicitly asks for it.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>attrnames</b> - list of names of attributes of the cache; the language will
				be selected based on the <b>langpref</b> argument.</p>
				<p>Note: currently each of the OC installations has its own set of attributes. That's
				why we don't reference them by their IDs - we only return them as text. This could change
				*if* OC installations would begin to use UUIDs for their attributes and synchronize them
				between all installations.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>latest_logs</b> - a couple of latest log entries in the cache.
				The format is the same as the one returned by the services/logs/logs method.</p>

			We have already one universally unique key - the cache code. It is uncommon
			to have multiple universally unique keys. -->
			<li><b>internal_id</b> - internal ID of the cache (<b>do not</b> use
				this, unless you know what you're doing; use the "code" as an identifier).</li>
		</ul>
	</opt>
	<opt name='lpc' default='10'>
		Log-entries per cache - the number of logs returned in the <b>latest_logs</b> field.
		This should be an integer or a special "all" value. Please note, that you must include
		the <b>latest_logs</b> field in <b>fields</b> in order to see the log entries.
	</opt>
	<opt name='my_location'>
		<p>The reference point for cache distance and bearing calculation (typically - the user's location),
		in the "lat|lon" format. This parameter is required when accessing <b>distance</b> and/or <b>bearing</b>
		fields.</p>
		<p>Use positive numbers for latitudes in the northern hemisphere and
		longitudes in the eastern hemisphere (and negative for southern and
		western hemispheres accordingly). These are full degrees with a dot
		as a decimal point (ex. "54.3|22.3").</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name="user_uuid">
		<p>User'd ID. Required to access fields like <b>is_found</b> using <b>Level 1</b> Authentication.</p>
		<p>Please note that if you want to access private fields (like <b>my_notes</b>), then
		this parameter won't help you. You have to use <b>Level 3</b> Authentication instead.</p>
		<p>If you use <b>Level 3</b> Authentication, you shouldn't use this parameter. Or, to be exact:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>user_uuid</b> will be extracted from the Access Token you use. You don't have to provide it.</li>
			<li>If you provide <b>user_uuid</b>, then it HAS TO match your Access Token. If it doesn't, OKAPI
			will respond with HTTP 400 error.</li>
		</ul>
	</opt>
	<common-format-params/>
	<returns>
		<p>A dictionary of fields you have selected.</p>
		<p>For example, for <i>geocache?cache_code=OP3D96&amp;fields=type</i>
		query, the result might look something link this:</p>
		<pre>{"type": "Traditional"}</pre>
		<p>If given cache code does not exist, the method will
		respond with an HTTP 400 error.</p>
