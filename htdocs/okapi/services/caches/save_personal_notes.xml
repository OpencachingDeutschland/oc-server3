        <p>This method allows your users to to change the content of the user's
        personal note from one value to the other value.</p>

        <p>We <b>want</b> you to know the pervious value of the personal note,
        because we feel that your user needs to know what it is exactly that is
        going to be replaced.</p>

        <p>Please note, that we <b>do not require</b> you to know - the
        <b>old_value</b> parameter is optional. However, if you don't provide
        it (or provide an obsolete value), then your <b>new_value</b> will be
        appended to the current personal note instead of replacing it.</p>

        <p>Current personal user notes for the geocache can be retrieved
        using the <b>my_notes</b> field in the
        <a href="%OKAPI:methodargref:services/caches/geocache#fields%">services/caches/geocache</a>
        method.</p>

                provided. If the note has been removed, <b>null</b> is
                returned.
            </li>
