    <brief>Search for caches within specified bounding box</brief>
    <issue-id>16</issue-id>
    <desc>
        <p>This method is similar to the search/all method, but the results
        are restricted to the caches situated within a given bounding box
        (a rectangle on the map).</p>
        <p>Unless overriden, results are ordered by the distance from the center of the bounding
        box. This means, that if you hit the limit of geocaches
        returned, you will receive the ones that are in the middle of your
        box, and miss the ones on the edges.</p>
        <p>Usually you will want to use search_and_retrieve method instead of this one.
        This way, you can get much more data in <b>one request</b>.</p>

    <req name='bbox'>
        <p>The bounding box within to search for caches. The box is defined
        by a string in "<b>S|W|N|E</b>" format, where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>S</b> stands for southern edge latitude of the box,</li>
            <li><b>W</b> stands for western edge longitude of the box,</li>
            <li><b>N</b> stands for northern edge latitude of the box,</li>
            <li><b>E</b> stands for eastern edge longitude of the box.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use positive numbers for latitudes in the northern hemisphere and
        longitudes in the eastern hemisphere (and negative for southern and
        western hemispheres accordingly). These are full degrees with a dot
        as a decimal point (ex. "48.7|15.8|54|24.9").</p>
