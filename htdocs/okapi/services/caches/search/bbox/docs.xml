    <brief>Search for caches within specified bounding box</brief>
    <issue-id>16</issue-id>
    <desc>
        <p>This method is similar to the search/all method, but the results
        are restricted to the caches situated within a given bounding box
        (a rectangle on the map).</p>

        <p>Unless overriden, results are ordered by the distance from the
        center of the bounding box. This means, that if the number of geocaches
        in the box exceeds the your limit (provided in the <b>limit</b>
        parameter), you will receive the ones that are in the middle of your
        box, and miss the ones on the edges.</p>

        <p>Usually you will want to use search_and_retrieve method instead of this one.
        This way, you can get much more data in <b>one request</b>.</p>

    <req name='bbox'>
        <p>The bounding box within to search for caches. The box is defined
        by a string in "<b>S|W|N|E</b>" format, where:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>S</b> stands for southern edge latitude of the box,</li>
            <li><b>W</b> stands for western edge longitude of the box,</li>
            <li><b>N</b> stands for northern edge latitude of the box,</li>
            <li><b>E</b> stands for eastern edge longitude of the box.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Use positive numbers for latitudes in the northern hemisphere and
        longitudes in the eastern hemisphere (and negative for southern and
        western hemispheres accordingly). These are full degrees with a dot
        as a decimal point (ex. "48.7|15.8|54|24.9").</p>
