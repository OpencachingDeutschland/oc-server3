	<brief>Search for nearest geocaches</brief>
	<issue-id>17</issue-id>
	<desc>
		<p>Find the nearest geocaches. Unless overriden, results are ordered by the distance from
		the given center point.</p>
		<p>Usually you will want to use search_and_retrieve method instead of this one.
		This way, you can get much more data in <b>one request</b>.</p>
	</desc>
	<req name='center'>
		<p>The center point (typically - the user's location), in the
		"lat|lon" format.</p>
		<p>Use positive numbers for latitudes in the northern hemisphere and
		longitudes in the eastern hemisphere (and negative for southern and
		western hemispheres accordingly). These are full degrees with a dot
		as a decimal point (ex. "54.3|22.3").</p>
	</req>
	<opt name='radius'>
		<p>Maximal distance (from the center point) for the cache to
		be included in the results. Unlike in most other places, this
		distance is given <b>in kilometers</b> instead of meters
		(it can contain a floating point though).</p>
	</opt>
	<import-params method='services/caches/search/all'/>
	<common-format-params/>
	<returns>
		<p>Same format as in the search/all method. The <b>more</b> key will
		be skipped when no <b>radius</b> argument is given.</p>
	</returns>
