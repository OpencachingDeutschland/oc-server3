        <p>This works similar to the <b>search/all</b> method, but the returned
        set of geocaches is temporarilly stored, instead of being directly
        returned to you.</p>
        <p>You may want to use this method when you don't want your search
        results modified while the user is browsing through them, page by page.
        To view a portion of a saved search, use the <b>search/all</b>
        method with proper <b>set_and</b> <u>and <b>status</b></u> (!)
        parameters.</p>
    </desc>
    <opt name='min_store' default="300">
        The amount of time (in seconds) after which you allow OKAPI to delete
        the set (OKAPI <b>may</b> remove it, but doesn't have to).
        The maximum allowed value is 64800 (18 hours).
    </opt>
    <opt name='ref_max_age' default="300">
        <p>If OKAPI finds an existing result set which was created for your
        search query, it may return the ID of this existing set (and possibly
        extend its lifetime so it fits your <b>min_store</b>). What is the
        maximum age of the existing result set which you are willing to accept?</p>
        <p>This should be an integer (in seconds) <b>or</b> a special
        <b>nolimit</b> value. It must be greater or equal to 300 (5 minutes).</p>
    </opt>

    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary of the following structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>set_id</b> - string, the identifier of your saved set,
            for future reference.</li>
        </ul>
