    <brief>Retrieve information on multiple log entries</brief>

    <desc>
        <p>This method works like the services/logs/entry method, but works
        with multiple log entries (instead of only one).</p>
    </desc>
    <req name='log_uuids'>
        <p>Pipe-separated list of UUIDs. These represent the log entries you
        are interested in. No more than 500 codes are allowed.
        Unlike in the "entry" method, this CAN be an empty string (it will
        result in an empty, but valid, response).</p>
    </req>
    <opt name='fields' default='date|user|type|comment'>
        <p>Same as in the services/logs/entry method. Pipe-separated list
        of field names which you are interested with.
        See services/logs/entry method for a list of available values.</p>
    </opt>
    <common-format-params/>
    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary. UUIDs you provide will be mapped to dictionary keys,
        and each value will be a dictionary of fields you have selected.</p>
        <p>Value of <b>null</b> means that the given UUID haven't been found.
        (This behavior is different than in the services/logs/entry method, which
        responds with an HTTP 400 error in such case.)</p>
    </returns>
