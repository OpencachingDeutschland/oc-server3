		<p>Currently available fields:</p>

			<li><b>cache_code</b> - code of the cache which the log entry refers to,</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>date</b> - date and time (ISO 8601) when the log entry was submitted.</p>

				<ul>

					<li><b>username</b> - name of the user (who submitted the log entry),</li>
					<li><b>profile_url</b> - URL of the profile page of the user,</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>type</b> - string; log type. This could be <b>pretty much everything</b>, but
				there are five primary types:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>"Found it" and "Didn't find it" - for all Non-Event Caches,</li>
					<li>"Will attend" and "Attended" - for Event Caches,</li>
					<li>"Comment" - for all cache types.</li>
				</ul>

				in this log entry,</p>
			</li>
			<li><b>comment</b> - HTML string, text entered with the log entry,</li>

				<p><b>internal_id</b> - undocumented, you <u>should not</u> use
				this unless you really know you need to. Internal IDs are
				<b>not</b> unique across various OKAPI installations.
				Try to use UUIDs instead.</p>
