        <p>A dictionary of the following structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>success</b> - <b>true</b>, if all went well,</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note, that this will <em>always</em> be true! Nothing can go
        wrong as long as you pass your parameters in a right way (and if you
        don't, you will get an HTTP 400 response). If you have received an HTTP
        200 response, then you may assume that all went well.</p>
