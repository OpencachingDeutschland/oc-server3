	<issue-id>42</issue-id>
	<desc>
		<p>Submit a log entry for the geocache. Please note, that you won't be
		able to use this method until you learn to handle OAuth.</p>
	</desc>
	<req name='cache_code'>
		<p>Code of the geocache.</p>
	</req>
	<req name='logtype'>
		<p>Type of an entry. This should be one of: <i>Found it</i>, <i>Didn't find it</i>
		or <i>Comment</i>. Currently this method does not support "Will attend" nor "Attended"
		log types which are used for Event Caches (we are planning to add this).</p>
	</req>
	<opt name='comment'>
		<p>Text to be submitted with the log entry. Plain-text (no HTML).</p>
		<p><b>Note:</b> Due to <a href='http://code.google.com/p/opencaching-api/issues/detail?id=124'>some issues</a>
		(which we cannot currently fix), you MAY be allowed to use some basic HTML tags (on some OC installations).
		However, you should not (this may stop working at any time).</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='when'>
		<p>A date and time string. This should be in ISO 8601 format (currently any
		format acceptable by PHP's <a href='http://pl2.php.net/strtotime'>strtotime</a>
		function also will do, but most of them don't handle time zones properly,
		try to use ISO 8601!).</p>
		<p>Indicates when the cache was found. If given, the log will be published
		with the given date and time. If not, log will be published using the current
		date and time.</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='password'>
		<p>Some caches require a password in order to submit a "Found it" log entry.
		You may check if this cache requires password with <b>req_passwd</b> field
		of the services/caches/geocache method.</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='langpref' default='en'>
		<p>Pipe-separated list of ISO 639-1 language codes. This indicates the
		order of preference in which language will be chosen for error messages.</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='on_duplicate' default='silent_success'>
		<p>How should OKAPI react when you are trying to submit a duplicate entry?
		One of the following values:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>silent_success</b> - try to respond with success=true, but don't
			add a new log entry (existing log_uuid will be returned),</li>
			<li><b>user_error</b> - respond with success=false and a proper user message,</li>
			<li><b>continue</b> - don't detect duplicates (note, that this will still
			fail in some cases, i.e. when you're trying to submit a "Found it" entry for an
			already found cache).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note, that duplicate detection may take the <b>when</b> parameter into account.
		When you don't supply it, "when" is generated for you. This means that you may
		have to supply the "when" parameter if you want duplicate detection to work.</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='rating'>
		<p>An integer in range between 1 and 5 - user's optional rating of a found cache.</p>
		<p>Important: <b>logtype</b> has to be "Found it" in order to use this argument.</p>
		<p>Note: You should allow your user to <b>not</b> rate a found cache.</p>
		<p>Note: Currently, some OC installations do not support cache ratings. On such installations
		user's rating will be <b>ignored</b> (if you include the rating, log entry will be posted
		successfully, but rating will be ignored).</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='recommend' default='false'>
		<p>Set to <b>true</b> if the user wants to recommend this cache.</p>
		<p>Important: <b>logtype</b> has to be "Found it" in order to use this argument.</p>
		<p>Recommending may only succeed when the user meets certain criteria
		set on him by the OC site. If criteria are not met, the request will
		end with user error (HTTP 200, success=false).</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='needs_maintenance' default='false'>
		<p>Set to <b>true</b> if the user thinks that the cache needs some special attension
		of its owner. Users should describe the reason for maintenance in their comments.</p>
		<p>Note: Depending on OC installation and user's log entry type, OKAPI may actually
		publish two separate log entries when you check this flag (one of them with empty
		comment). Even then, you will still receive only one UUID reference (pointing to
		only one of those entries). Moreover, on some OC servers this flag might be
		<b>completely ignored</b> (not all OC servers support this feature).</p>
	</opt>
	<common-format-params/>
	<returns>
		<p>A dictionary of the following structure:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>success</b> - true, if the log entry was submitted successfully,</li>
			<li><b>message</b> - plain-text string, a message for the user, which acknowledges success
				or describes an error (usually you want to display this only when success is false),</li>
			<li><b>log_uuid</b> - ID of the newly created log entry, <b>or null</b>
				in case of an error.</li>
		</ul>
	</returns>
