    <returns>
        <p>A list of log entries, ordered by descending date. Each entry is a
        dictionary of the following format:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>uuid</b> - ID of the log entry,</li>
            <li>
                <p><b>date</b> - date and time (ISO 8601) when the log entry was submitted.</p>
                <p>Please note that log entries often contain dates only (with the times
                truncated to midnight, as in the local timezone). In such cases, you may
                want to avoid displaying the time. You may assume that if the <b>date</b>
                value contains the "00:00:00" string, then it is date-only.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>cache_code</b> - code of the geocache,</li>
            <li>
                <p><b>type</b> - string; log type. This could be <b>pretty much
                everything</b>, but there are some primary types (see logs/entry
                method for more info).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>comment</b> - <a href='%OKAPI:docurl:html%'>HTML string</a>, text entered
                with the log entry.
            </li>
        </ul>
