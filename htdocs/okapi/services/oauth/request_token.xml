        <p>Get a new unauthorized OAuth Request Token. This token is bound to
        the Consumer it was issued to. It has a short expiration date and
        can be used in one way only - first it has to get authorized by
        the user, then it has to be exchanged for an Access Token.</p>
    </desc>
    <req name='oauth_callback'>
        <p>URL which you want a User to be redirected to after a
        successful Request Token Authorization (see "authorize" method).
        If the client is unable to receive callbacks, the parameter
        must be set to "oob", OKAPI will provide a user with a
        PIN code (oauth_verifier) in this case.</p>
        Consult <a href='http://oauth.net/documentation/spec/'>OAuth documentation</a> for details.
    </req>
    <returns>
        <p>Standard OAuth 1.0a Token response - a string in a form-encoded format:</p>
        <pre>oauth_token=...&amp;oauth_token_secret=...&amp;oauth_callback_confirmed=true</pre>
        <p>You <b>must</b> be prepared that there might be more parameters returned
        in the future (you should ignore them gracefully).</p>
    </returns>
