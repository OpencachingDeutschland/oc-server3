        <p>Retrieve information on a single user, referencing him by his <b>internal</b> ID.</p>
        <p>In general, you should not use this method. Reference your users by their
        normal ID - <b>user_uuid</b>. Also, internal IDs are not universally unique and are
        a poor choice for a key.</p>
