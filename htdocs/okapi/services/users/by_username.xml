        <p>Retrieve information on a single user, referencing him by his username.</p>
        <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> user IDs don't change, but usernames <b>may</b> change.</p>
        <p>Usually, you'll want to run this method only once, in order to get the IDs
        of referenced users. You should not store usernames in your database, it is
        much safer to reference them by their IDs.</p>

    <req name='fields'>

    </req>
    <common-format-params/>
    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary of fields you have selected.</p>
