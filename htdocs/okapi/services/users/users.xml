    <desc>
        <p>This method works like the services/users/user method, but works
        with multiple users (instead of only one).</p>
    </desc>
    <req name='user_uuids'>
        <p>Pipe-separated list of user IDs. No more than 500 IDs are allowed.</p>
    </req>
    <req name='fields'>
        <p>Same as in the services/users/user method. Pipe-separated list
        of field names which you are interested with.
        See services/users/user method for a list available values.</p>
    </req>
    <common-format-params/>
    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary. User IDs you provide will be mapped to dictionary keys,
        and each value will be a dictionary of fields you have selected.</p>

        <p>Value of <b>null</b> means that the given user haven't been found.
        (This behavior is different than in the services/users/user method, which
        responds with an HTTP 400 error in such case.)</p>
    </returns>
