	ABOUT
	This PHP script will randomly select an image file from a
	folder of images on your webserver.  You can then link to it
	as you would any standard image file and you'll see a random
	image each time you reload.
	
	When you want to add or remove images from the rotation-pool,
	just add or remove them from the image rotation folder.


	VERSION CHANGES
	Version 1.0
		- Release version
	
	Version 1.5
		- Tweaked a few boring bugs
	
	Version 2.0
		- Complete rewrite from the ground-up
		- Made it clearer where to make modifications
		- Made it easier to specify/change the rotation-folder
		- Made it easier to specify/change supported image types
		- Wrote better instructions and info (you're them reading now)
		- Significant speed improvements
		- More error checking
		- Cleaner code (albeit more PHP-specific)
		- Better/faster random number generation and file-type parsing
		- Added a feature where the image to display can be specified
		- Added a cool feature where, if an error occurs (such as no
		  images being found in the specified folder) *and* you're
		  lucky enough to have the GD libraries compiled into PHP on
		  your webserver, we generate a replacement "error image" on
		  the fly.
		
    Version 2.1
        - Updated a potential security flaw when value-matching
          filenames

    Version 2.2
        - Updated a few more potential security issues
        - Optimized the code a bit.
        - Expanded the doc for adding new mime/image types.

        Thanks to faithful ALA reader Justin Greer for
        lots of good tips and solid code contribution!


	INSTRUCTIONS
	1. Modify the $folder setting in the configuration section below.
	2. Add image types if needed (most users can ignore that part).
	3. Upload this file (rotate.php) to your webserver.  I recommend
	   uploading it to the same folder as your images.
	4. Link to the file as you would any normal image file, like this:

			<img src="http://example.com/rotate.php">

	5. You can also specify the image to display like this:

			<img src="http://example.com/rotate.php?img=gorilla.jpg">
		
		This would specify that an image named "gorilla.jpg" located
		in the image-rotation folder should be displayed.
	
	That's it, you're done.

/* ------------------------- CONFIGURATION -----------------------


	Set $folder to the full path to the location of your images.
	For example: $folder = '/user/me/example.com/images/';
	If the rotate.php file will be in the same folder as your
	images then you should leave it set to $folder = '.';

*/

	if (!empty($_REQUEST["path"]))
		$folder = basename($_REQUEST["path"]);		// strip dirs for security reasons
	else
		$folder = '.';

/*	

	Most users can safely ignore this part.  If you're a programmer,
	keep reading, if not, you're done.  Go get some coffee.

    If you'd like to enable additional image types other than
	gif, jpg, and png, add a duplicate line to the section below
	for the new image type.
	
	Add the new file-type, single-quoted, inside brackets.
	
	Add the mime-type to be sent to the browser, also single-quoted,
	after the equal sign.
	
	For example:
	
	PDF Files:

		$extList['pdf'] = 'application/pdf';
	
    CSS Files:

        $extList['css'] = 'text/css';

    You can even serve up random HTML files:

	    $extList['html'] = 'text/html';
	    $extList['htm'] = 'text/html';

    Just be sure your mime-type definition is correct!

*/

	$extList = array();
	$extList['gif'] = 'image/gif';
	$extList['jpg'] = 'image/jpeg';
	$extList['jpeg'] = 'image/jpeg';
	$extList['png'] = 'image/png';

	// interval in seconds when to switch to the next image
	$interval = 300;

// You don't need to edit anything after this point.
