		<b>What is a "geocache" in our terms?</b>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A geocache is a hidden container with a logbook, which has to be found by 
		geographical coordinates. As proof of finding, the finder writes a record in 
		the logbook. Alternatively, there may be no container, but the user will have to 
		visit the location, maybe to a quest there, and proof this e.g. by a photo or by 
		determining a log password on site. This type of containerless cache is called a 
		"virtual cache".
	</p>
			
	<p>
		<b>Terms for hiding a geocache and publishing it at Opencaching.de website</b>
	</p>
			
	<ul class="indent">
		<li>
			You will hide the geocache at your own intention and risk &ndash; Opencaching.de 
			will not be liably for any damages which may be caused by the cache. The cache 
			owner is responsible for any damages caused by the cache.
		</li>
		<li>
			Geocaches may only be hidden at publicly accessible locations.
		</li>
		<li>
			Placing the geocache must be allowed by the owner or holder of the property.
		</li>
		<li>
			The geocache and the listing at Opencaching.de may not contain any illegal or 
			dangerous contents. Expecially, laws for copyright, youth protection and nature 
			and environment protection are applicable.
		</li>
		<li>
			Commercial caches are not allowed. A cache is considered commercial if it was 
			hidden with the intention of making profit. In the case of doubt, the cache 
			description must clarify that the cache is non-commercial. Also, the cache 
			listing, user names and cache logs shall not contain any advertisement.
		</li>
		<li>
			The cache description must point out any dangers which may arise from seeking 
			the geocache.
		</li>
		<li>
			The geocache has to be marked as geocache and must contain contact information 
			of its owner.
		</li>
		<li>
			The cache owner commits himself to keep the cache in good shape and to dispose 
			it after use as geocache, and to eliminate any damage which have been caused by 
			the cache.
		</li>
		<li>
			The cache owner permits any third parties to publish the original (unchanged) 
			cache description free of charge.
		</li>
		<li>
			Cache logs by Opencaching.de users may not be generally prohibited. Also, users 
			may not be forced to do log entries at other websites.
		</li>
		<li>
			If the geocache is also listed at other websites, the cache description has to 
			be kept up-to-date and complete at all websites. Description updates have to be 
			done in the same manner at all websites.
		</li>
	</ul>
			
	<p>
		<b>Terms for seeking a geocache</b>

			regarding the rights of property owners, nature protection and environment 
			protection.
