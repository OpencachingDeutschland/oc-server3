These are the reference defitions of all OCDE database tables (excluding OKAPI).

When changing a table definition, do it (a) here and (b) by adding a mutation
function to bin/dbsv-update.php, then run bin/dbsv-update.php to update your DB.

translate.php "SQL Export" writes the defition of your local database's tables
to the .sql files. Then you can look for differences by "git diff".

http://OC.site/okapi/devel/dbstruct shows you the DB stuctures of an OC site.
Add "&compare=http://another.OC.site/okapi/devel/dbstruct" to compare DB structs
of two OC sites (including your local devel site).
